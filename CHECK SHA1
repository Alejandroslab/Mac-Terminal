Checking SHA1 Hash in Mac OS X

Use command shasum

shasum ~/Desktop/DownloadedFile.dmg

An easy way to check SHA1 files buried deep in the file system without typing out the full path, is to type the first part of the command 
then drag and drop the file into the Terminal window. This automatically types the path for you:

shasum (drag and drop file here)

The default for the shasum command is to use SHA1, the most common hash type, but this can be changed with the -a flag if necessary 
to 224, 256, 384, or 512. Also, though SHA1 is becoming more common than MD5, you can still easily check md5 hash in Mac OS X as well with the md5 command.


You can use also:


openssl sha -sha256  (name of file. drag your file here)
