First download GnuPG or GPG

to do that in Mac you need brew package manager

you can install it googling to the official page

Second import the public key of the author with

gpg --keyserver pool.sks-keyservers.net --recv-keys 0x4E2C6E8793298290
another example

gpg --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-key "27DE B156 44C6 B3CF 3BD7  D291 300F 846B A25B AE09"

gpg --recv-key 4E777CA3

where 0x4E2C6E8793298290 is the public key of the author.

After that if you don't have .asc file (or .sig file) just create one coping and pasting the signature of the file
you want to verify on a text editor.

Then save the file as .asc (not .txt)

Remember to copy also the name of the file you want to verify and rename the .asc file with that.

Then for verification just:

gpg --verify (drag .asc file or drag .sig file if you have it(file provided by the authors)) (drag .dmg file to be verified or other file like .iso to be verified)

or in case of linux mint

gpg --verify sha256sum.txt.gpg(file provided by authors) sha256sum.txt (file to be verified) (just drag and drop)
