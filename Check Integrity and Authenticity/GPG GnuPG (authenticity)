First download GnuPG or GPG

to do that in Mac you need brew package manager

you can install it googling to the official page

then install gnupg with



brew install gnupg

If you have some troubles (like xcrun missing )
proceed to installed xcode utils:

xcode-select --install


Now import the public key of the author download the .asc file from the webpage
or you can just copy and paste the code and create a new file with
.asc extension

Remember to copy also the name of the file you want to verify and rename the .asc file with that.


To import

gpg --import nameofthefile.asc

you can also drag and drop the file .asc to the terminal



other ways to import

gpg --keyserver pool.sks-keyservers.net --recv-keys 0x4E2C6E8793298290
another example

gpg --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-key "27DE B156 44C6 B3CF 3BD7  D291 300F 846B A25B AE09"

gpg --recv-key 4E777CA3

where 0x4E2C6E8793298290 is the public key of the author.


to list now all the keys type

gpg --list-keys





Then for verification just:

gpg --verify (drag .asc file or drag .sig file if you have it(file provided by the authors)) (drag .dmg file to be verified or other file like .iso to be verified)






or in case of linux mint

gpg --verify sha256sum.txt.gpg(file provided by authors) sha256sum.txt (file to be verified) (just drag and drop)


Now if it appears 'Good signature..'

you are done ! you know that that key is public signed by whom has
told you so

But now it appears the message:
gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.

this means that you have to sign the signature that means in a sense, that you
have to 'approve' the signature.
that WARNING is perfectly ok at least until you
don't approve the signature as 'trusted'
