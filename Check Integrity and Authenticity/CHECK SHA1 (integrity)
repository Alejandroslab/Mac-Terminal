Checking SHA1 Hash in Mac OS X

Use command shasum

shasum ~/Desktop/DownloadedFile.dmg

An easy way to check SHA1 files buried deep in the file system without typing out the full path, is to type the first part of the command
then drag and drop the file into the Terminal window. This automatically types the path for you:

shasum (drag and drop file here)

The default for the shasum command is to use SHA1, the most common hash type, but this can be changed with the -a flag if necessary
to 224, 256, 384, or 512. Also, though SHA1 is becoming more common than MD5, you can still easily check md5 hash in Mac OS X as well with the md5 command.



to use sha256 check:

shasum  -a 256 (drag and drop file here)


When you download a program you will always get a checksum file
This extra file contains the reference checksum calculated over the server's file, and that is the exact same value that we should obtain in our computer from the downloaded copy.

to check an .iso.sha256 just:

cat myprogram.iso.sha256

and compare with the result that you get from the program you downloaded with:

shasum  -a 256 myprogram.iso


The above process is what we need to do for the software we download manually, from the web.

Package Managers for GNU/Linux, as apt, pacman or yum among others, for Windows as Chocolatey, and for macOS as homebrew, should do all the avobe automatically, transparently and by default. Check the documentation of the system and package manager you use (and trust) to check specific details.

Or you can use also:


openssl sha256  (name of file. drag your file here)
