You can set your shortcuts in preferences

In particular to move between windows you have to look for Navigation Shortcuts

Remember that shortcuts can be Global but also defined in your Profile

If you try to override a shortcut in your profile section
you will be warned

Anyways to move between split panes select a shortcut under
Preferences>Keys>Navigation Shortcuts>Shortcut to choose a split pane

done
