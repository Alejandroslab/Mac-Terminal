iTerm is way better than the Terminal itself

It is fully customisable


You can set the colors of the terminal text inside:
Settings < Profiles < Colors
'Foreground' is the color of the text
'Background' is the color of the window terminal

For the prompt you must change the system setting with PROMPT or PS1 accordingly
