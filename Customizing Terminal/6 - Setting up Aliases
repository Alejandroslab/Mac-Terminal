In Mac remember that you have zsh as shell and not bash anymore

If you have installed the oh my zsh package when you enter in the configuration file that is:

~/.zshrc

You will see in the Alias corresponding section that if you have installed the oh my zsh package you should insert your aliases inside the custom folder

Therefore, following the suggestion we will do so!

    Go to the folder $ cd ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom
    Create a new .zsh file. You can name it what ever youâ€™d like, but for testing, I created aliases.zsh


    Add you new aliases to your new file. You can do this by opening the file with your preferred text editor:

    Here's a possible file:

#An alias to naviage up one directory level
alias up='cd ..'
alias x="exit"

You can also ovverride in this way existing commands..
