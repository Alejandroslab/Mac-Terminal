Inside the line:

PROMPT='%{$fg[green]%}%n~%{$fg_bold[blue]%}$(git_prompt_info)%{$reset_color%} '

You can see also some symbols with % and a letter


Here is a legend:

________
%M: This shows the machine's hostname.

%m: Same as the previous. Hostname is printed up to the first dot (.) separator. It takes an optional integer after % for the number of components to be displayed.

%n: this will show the username

This will have the same effect as printing environment variable $USERNAME.

%d or %/: This shows the current directory. Works just as printing the $PWD environment variable.

%~: Same as the previous, but if the current directory is $HOME, ~ is displayed instead.

%c or %.: This lists the amount of directories trailing $PWD. It takes an integer as the parameter after %. Thus, %2c would show the two preceding directories to $PWD.

%C: Same as the previous, but directory names are not replaced with any symbols.

%D: This prints the current system date in the yy-mm-dd format.

%W: Same as the previous but in mm/dd/yy format.

%w: This shows the date in day-dd format.

%T: This displays the current time of the day, 24-hour format.

%t or %@: Same as the previous, uses a 12-hour, am/pm format.

%*: Same as the previous, also displays seconds.
