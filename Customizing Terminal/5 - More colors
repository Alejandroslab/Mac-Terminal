If you want more colors you can also change the line :


PROMPT='%{$fg[green]%}%~%{$fg_bold[blue]%}$(git_prompt_info)%{$reset_color%} '

with some code colors instead of the word (like '118' instead of green or '040' instead of orange)

to know all the possible colors, after having install oh-my-zsh run:

spectrum_ls

This command will list all the colors available with their code

Then you change this:
$fg[green]

with this:

$FG[118]

REMEMBER! it is 'FG' with capital letters and not 'fg'
And done
