Inside the mytheme file you can customise the shell

Here is an example:

Copy and paste this:

___
#copy from here inside the theme file

PROMPT='%{$fg[green]%}%~%{$fg_bold[blue]%}$(git_prompt_info)%{$reset_color%} '

ZSH_THEME_GIT_PROMPT_PREFIX="("
ZSH_THEME_GIT_PROMPT_SUFFIX=")"
ZSH_THEME_GIT_PROMPT_DIRTY=" ✗"
ZSH_THEME_GIT_PROMPT_CLEAN=" ✔"

#last line to copy

_____

now the real line that will customise the shell is the first one
all the command after 'PROMPT= '

Try to change the part on the right of the "= ":

PROMPT='%{$fg[green]%}%~%{$fg_bold[blue]%}$(git_prompt_info)%{$reset_color%} '

This 'PROMPT' line is the same as 'PS1' in bash. In zsh it has been changed to 'PROMPT'

Remember that you can add spaces, text and even emoji!

You can also see some colors like 'green', 'blue' etc
you can change with 'red' , 'yellow' etc
