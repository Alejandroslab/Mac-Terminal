Since Catalina the new shell is 'zsh' and not bash anymore

Therefore to customise the terminal you can download a manager that is called 'oh-my-zsh'

This will allow you to install themes that will change your zsh shell

You can search it online
Here is the last code to install it:

sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"

This manager will install the themes alongside with some other tools and utilities (like 'spectrum_ls' that will allow you to choose more colors )

oh-my-zsh stores these themes in the ~/.oh-my-zsh/themes folder.
If you ls ~/.oh-my-zsh/themes you will see a list of predefined themes

The manager will be able to recognise also your customised themes that are located on:
~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/themes

Just create a file inside this folder called:

mytheme.zsh-theme

.zsh-theme is the extension that will allow the manager to recognise it as a zsh theme.

The manager will inspect that folder so you do not need to do anything else

You will need just to configure your file and then edith the '.zshrc' file indicating the name of the theme:

nano ~/.zshrc

look for:

ZSH_THEME="themename"

and set it with the name of the theme file that you have created

ZSH_THEME="myname"

Finally refresh the profile running (remmeber the point before the command!);

. ~/.zshrc

or

exec zsh

 And done!
