To make executable a file just:

Create a text edit with the command.
(remember that in order to save .txt you need to check if Preferences of Text Edit is selected the 'Plain Text' option).

Save the file with another extension like '.in'

Finally open terminal and type

chmod +x (and drag the .in file created)

After pressing enter the file is executable.
