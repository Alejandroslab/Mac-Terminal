After you create your sh script (like a QEMU vm)
Click right and 'Get Info'

In 'Open With' set 'Terminal'

Then close it

Now you can rename your sh file in .app file. You can also change the name.

after that if you wish you can set an icon for you script (see the instructions)

Now drag it to the dock.

You can also drag without having to change the extension to .app
but this will allow you to only add it to the right side of the dock (the side of the folders) and not anywhere

After dragging it in your dock

Go to your folder and change back the extension to .sh as otherwise the system will not recognize it as an app


AND done!
Now if you click on the dock icon Terminal will run with your script (check how to close it automatically after the script terminates)


(This has worked for a QEMU script that launches a VM )

remember that for the QEMU script you need to specify the path fully and you cannot use the '~' to indicate the homefolder

therefore the line:

-drive file=ubuntu-desktop-18.04.qcow2,if=virtio \

must become

-drive file=/Users/MyUser/QEMU/ubuntu-desktop-18.04.qcow2,if=virtio \
