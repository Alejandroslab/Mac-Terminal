in order to see differences of the same file that has been modified

git diff file.txt

you will see the difference between the file previous the edit and after the edit in detail.

This will work ONLY in the working folder (or also called working copy). 

It will not work if the files are already in staging phase.

If files are in staging we have to use:

git diff --cached file.txt
