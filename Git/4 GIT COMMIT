So this is the part in which from 'staging' we pass the files to the local repository

just typing:

git commit -m "Insert a message here"

Inside the ".." you should put a meaningful message in order to understand the changes.

finally if you run

git status 

you will see a message like

'Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 1 commit'

where 1 commit could be more than one as it depends on the number of changes that we have previously added with git add.
