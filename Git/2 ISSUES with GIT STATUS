in case something goes wrong in your local repository just run these commands:

rm -rf .git
rm -rf .git*

In order to delete any reference to git
So if you now run git status it will print that there are not local repositories


you can see with this if .git hidden folder is gone
ls -lah




So now you can start from scratch!

Remember before pushing make a backup of your files!
