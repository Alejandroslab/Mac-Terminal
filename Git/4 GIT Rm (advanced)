when you have to delete a file and if you don't want to delete manually the files from directory

you could use 

git rm file.txt 

the good thing is that with this command apart of deleting the change it will be also staged so there will be 
no necessary of 'git add..' (2 steps in 1 command)



there is also 

git rm --cached file.txt 



and finally you can do the same for an entire folder

git rm -r <folderpath>
