#First type

ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "myemail@email.com"

When it asks for 'file in which to save the key' just press enter
Then it asks for a passphrase (if you want to create one). You can skip it just pressing enter again (it will be asked twice)

#Second type:

eval $(ssh-agent -s)

it will ask for the passphrase previously set and it will print something like:

'Agent pid  0029'

#Third,:

ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa

again it will ask for the passphrase previously set. then will print

'Identity added : ~/.ssh/id_rsa/ etc....'

#Finally you could go to your working (Home) folder enter in the folder .ssh (that is hidden) and open the file 
id_rsa.pub

Copy the code inside the file.

Go to github->settings> SSH and GPG Keys-> click on New SSH Key-> put a title and paste the code of the id_rsa.pub

click on add and you are done!
