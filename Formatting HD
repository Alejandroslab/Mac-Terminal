In Disk Utility in all devices click on

'Show all devices'

then select the device

you can then format like exfat select MBR (master boot record)
REMEMBER! if you select GUID instead of MBR windows will not correctly read the
device size




If you have problems formatting with disk utility use the following:

first to get the name to the disk you're trying to format

diskutil list

remember to change 'disk2' with the correct disk to format.

then unomunt the disk

diskutil unmountDisk force disk2

then write zeros on the boot sector:

sudo dd if=/dev/zero of=/dev/disk2 bs=1024 count=1024

finally format it with:

diskutil partitionDisk disk2 GPT JHFS+ "My External HD" 0g

done.
