To unlock files you can use:
chflags -R nouchg /PATH/TO/DIRECTORY/WITH/LOCKED/FILES/
	• chflags = change flags on files/folders such as "locked"
	• -R = recursive or for everything and follow directories within the specified directory
	• nouchg = means the file can be changed
/PATH/ = of course is the path to the files you want to change. Something like: ~/Sites/mysite/directory/with/locked/files/ works as well.
