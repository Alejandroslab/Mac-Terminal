when you want to exit
the teerminal you just type:

exit

Anyways, it will not close the terminal window

to close it
in terminal select:
Preferences > Profiles > (Select a Profile) > shell



on 'When the shell exits' choose
 'Close the window'

 now the next time the terminal will
 automatically close

 (you have to select the same Profile
 you set up like 'Homebrew' or others)
