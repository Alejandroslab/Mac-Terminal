Remember that for the Mac the main working folder is always 'Home' as it is stated even by the command 'cd' itself
when we type 'help cd':

cd [-L|-P] [dir]
    Change the current directory to DIR.  
    The variable $HOME is the default DIR.  The variable CDPATH defines the search path for
    the directory containing DIR.  Alternative directory names in CDPATH
    are separated by a colon (:).......
