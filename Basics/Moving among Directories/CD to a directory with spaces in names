In order to change directory from one directory to another that is called like 'GIT Repositories'

we should take in account the space between the words 'GIT' and 'Repositories'
as if we just type


cd ~/Users/HomeFolder/GIT Repositories/

we will get 'No such file or directory'

the correct way to do that is:

cd ~/GIT\ Repositories

So after the first word put immediately '\' then a 'space' and finally the second word that compose the name of the folder

Be careful

#another alternative is the following:

You can do that 'interactively':
You can use the Tab key after pressing the first few characters 
(this will then "fill in" the rest of the folder for you e.g. 

type cd ~/LTab fills in cd ~/Library/ then type ApTab (for completing with 'Application Support' 

and it will fill in the rest for you.
