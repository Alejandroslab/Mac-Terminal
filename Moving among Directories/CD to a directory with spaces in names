In order to change directory from one directory to another that is called like 'GIT Repositories'

we should take in account the space between the words 'GIT' and 'Repositories'
as if we just type


cd ~/Users/HomeFolder/GIT Repositories/

we will get 'No such file or directory'

the correct way to do that is:

cd ~/GIT\ Repositories

So after the first word put immediately '\' then a 'space' and finally the second word that compose the name of the folder

Be careful
