How to use git quickly to commit and push

1)first clone the repository copying the web url you find in clone button in the repository
then

git clone https://github.com/User/Repository.git

it will clone the repository as a folder in the Home folder

2)then configure your name and username (check it out) in order to be recognizable with this

git config --global user.name "My name"

git config --global user.email "My email"

after that with 
git status 
we can see that we are in our branch master

For example we want to commit and push a file
we can create a .txt file in the home folder
touch file.txt

Now we want to commit and push this file

3)first we should 'add' this file that is untracked. therefore

git add file.txt

with git status 
we can see difference

we are ready now to commit

4)git commit -m "Post here your message"

remember that the message is mandatory

now we are ready to push (upload) this file in the repository

5)git push origin master

___________

if you get an error like

fatal: 'origin' does not appear to be a git repository
fatal: Could not read from remote repository.

Please make sure you have the correct access rights
and the repository exists.

just add this>
git remote add origin https://github.com/User/Repository.git



with this you force it (be careful)

git push -f origin master
