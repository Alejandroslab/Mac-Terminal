First download GnuPG or GPG

Second import the public key of the author with

gpg --keyserver pool.sks-keyservers.net --recv-keys 0x4E2C6E8793298290

gpg --recv-key 4E777CA3

where 0x4E2C6E8793298290 is the public key of the author.

After that if you don't have .asc file (or .sig file) just create one coping and pasting the signature of the file 
you want to verify on a text editor.

Then save the file as .asc (not .txt)

Remember to copy also the name of the file you want to verify and rename the .asc file with that.

Then for verification just:

gpg --verify (drag .asc file or drag .sig file if you have it) (drag .dmg file to be verified or other file to be verified)
