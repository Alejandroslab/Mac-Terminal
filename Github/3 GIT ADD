when there are some changes after running

git status

you will see 'untracked files' and then a list of file that have been changed, removed or added

therefore to pass these changes to the next phase that is 'staging', you just use (as suggested by git code itself)

git add 

Now there are different ways to add the files, we just want all to be passed to the next phase therefore we use

git add -A (or alternatively git add --all)

that mean that all the files will be 'tracked

then we can see with another 

git status

that the files are passed from 'untracked' to 'tracked' (from red to green)
