there is also 

get add .

with this you will track (or 'stage') only all the files that are present in the folder that you are working on 

So if you for example are in a subfolder of your main working/local repository folder
the files that will be tracked are only all the files contained in the subfolder and not the changes outside of that subfolder.


and then 

get add *

with this command only the modification and added files will be staged but NOT the deleted ones.

and if you go in a subfolder will be the same: all the files of the subfolder that are new or modified will be staged (not deleted files)

and everything that is outside of the subfolder will not be taken in consideration


we can use this commands even for single extensions as for example:

git add *.txt

will stage the same files as previously explained but with the constraint that this time will be taken in account only
.txt files.
