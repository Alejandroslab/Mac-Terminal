After doing the SSH connection, that will allow you to avoid to insert everytime the password in order to PUSH to the remote server,
you can just do git INIT if you want to initialize a new folder that is in your working folder
or you can just do git CLONE if you want to copy a remote repository in your working folder.

Remember that you work in your working directory

then you can check for example
you make a change in a file, create a new file, delete a file, move a fie, etc with the command git STATUS

So after that 

files move from the working folder to the staging phase (with git ADD command) 
and finally to the local repository (with git COMMIT command)

so here is a scheme:

Working Folder -----------------> Staging  -------------------->  Local Repository
                (with git ADD)              (with git COMMIT)
