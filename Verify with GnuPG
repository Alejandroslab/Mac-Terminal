First download GnuPG

Second import the public key of the author with

gpg --keyserver pool.sks-keyservers.net --recv-keys 0x4E2C6E8793298290

where 0x4E2C6E8793298290 is the public key of the author.

After that if you don't have .asc file just create one coping and pasting the signature of the file you want to verify on a text editor
Then save the file as .asc (not .txt)
Remember to copy also the name of the file you want to verify and rename the .asc file with that.

Then for verification just:

gpg --verify (drag .asc file ) (drag .dmg file or other file to verify)
